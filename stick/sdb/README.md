# Controller Database
This folder contains a database of all gamepads / joysticks currently supported
by stick (This crate intends to support as many gamepads as possible).
Controller interfaces are different between operating systems, so they are
organized in folders by OS.  Each mapping uses TOML to specify how devices are
to be mapped.

## Example TOML Mapping File
```toml
# TODO
```
